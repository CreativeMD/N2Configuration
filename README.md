	Why an Api for ConfigFiles, while there is already an build in Api from forge?
	  A while ago I was strugling with the Config Mechanism from forge, and I felt like there were still
	  a few options missing after I (kinda) got it working. Thats why I started working on an API
	  which should make ConfigFiles easier to use for everybody!

	Tutorials
	  There are 3 tutorials included in the api (in the map Documentation). These explains how you
	  can use this api. There is also an summary/explanation of the mechanics of this api.

	Bug reports/suggestions
	  If you found a bug, or if you think a certain option should be added to this api, feel free to post it on
	  this Github, or on the forumPost:
