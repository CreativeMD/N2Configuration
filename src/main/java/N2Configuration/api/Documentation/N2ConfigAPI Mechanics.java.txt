    Directory - Mechanics
    ------------------------------
    
    Before jumping into the new mechanics of the ConfigFile, Lets take a look at the Directory
    mechanics first. The most common place for a ConfigFile is of course the '/config' Folder. Though
    you might want to store your files in other places, such as the WorldSave(for World Specific data)
    or you simply want an extra folder inside the '/config' Folder. For That purpose this implemented
    an way to register your own Directory! In the tutorials there will be more information on how to
    do that.
    
    Note, this is optional! You don't have to register/create your own Directory in order to store
    your own ConfigFile.
    
    
    Important related methods (N2ConfigApi)
     - registerCustomConfigDirectory(); - This will register an Directory inside the '/config' folder.
     - registerCustomDirectory(); - This will register an Directory wherever your destination input is.
     
     - getMCMainDir(); - This will return the MC Main Directory. 
     - getConfigDir(); - This will return the '/config' Directory.
     
     
     
     
     
     File - Mechanics
     ------------------------------
     
     If you register an ConfigFile, it will automatically register an File where your data will be stored.
     Although you can't manually register your (Configuration)File, you can use the Methods for your own
     Custom Files. Some methods require an FileType Enum, most of the time this will determine what
     extension the File should get. If you use FileType Original or Copy. the File extension will be the
     same.
     
     
     Important related methods (ConfigHandler)
     - generateSingeFile();                 - This will generate a single File, you have to put in your
                                              own extensions!
     - generateSingleFileFromConfigFile();  - This will do exactly the same, only for the ConfigFile
     - copyFile();                          - This will copy the content of one File, and paste it in the
                                              Other.
     - loadAndCheckConfigFile();            - This will load, generate, check and if needed regenerate the
                                              ConfigFile
     - loadConfigFile();                    - This will load and if needed write the ConfigFile.
     - loadAndCheckConfigFileList();        - This does the same as the 'loadAndCheckConfigFile()' method,
                                              except this does it for all the ConfigFiles which are in the List.
     - loadConfigFileList();                - This does the same as the 'loadConfigFile()' method, except
                                              this does it for all the ConfigFiles which are in the List.
     - removeConfigurationFile();           - This will delete a certain ConfigFile. Note, this will not
                                              delete the actual File!

    FileTypes: (Currently only used in the 'GenerateFile' methods)
    - Original - This will create an new (empty) File.
    - BackUP   - This will create an Backup from the InputFile. (fileName_BackUp.txt)
    - Temp     - This will create an Temporary File from the InputFile. (fileName_Temp.tmp)
                 Note, although this is an copy, its recommended to only use this, if its really an
                 Temporary File!
    - Clone    - This will create an Copy of the inputFile (fileName_Copyx.(extension, for configFiles '.cfg'))
    
    
    
    
    
    The ConfigFile! - Structure
    ------------------------------
    
    As it might be confusing how the API works, We'll try to explain the basic Structure of a ConfigFile.
    A ConfigFile is nothing more than a Collection of ConfigSections. In figure 01, a structure of an
    ConfigFile is displayed.
    
         figure 01 - ConfigFile Structure
         ____________________________________________________
        |ConfigFile - (ConfigSectionCollection)             |
        |                                                   |
        |   ConfigSection1                                  |
        |   ConfigSection2                                  |
        |   ConfigSection3 (ConfigSectoinCollection)        |
        |       ConfigSection3.1                            |
        |       ConfigSection3.2                            |
        |       ConfigSection3.3                            |
        |   ConfigSection4                                  |
        |   ConfigSection5                                  |
        |   ConfigSection6 (ConfigSectionCollection)        |
        |       ConfigSection 6.1                           |
        |       ConfigSection 6.2                           |
        |       ConfigSection 6.3 (ConfigSectionCollection) |
        |           ConfigSection 6.3.1                     |
        |           ConfigSection 6.3.2                     |
        |           ConfigSection 6.3.3                     |
        |       ConfigSection 6.4                           |
        |   ConfigSection7                                  |
        |   ConfigSection8                                  |
        |   ConfigSection9                                  |
        |___________________________________________________|

    
    As can be seen above, the ConfigFile on itself is considered an ConfigSectionCollection, This means
    that all methods from the ConfigSectionCollection can be called of an ConfigFile instance. Though
    there are a lot of methods in the CondfigFile Class replacing the ConfigSectionCollection methods.
    
    
    
    
    
    The ConfigFile! - ConfigSection
    ------------------------------

    The ConfigSection is the basic 'Build' material. An ConfigSection contains the elements displayed below.
    All of these fields can be set manually, but when you use the addMethod from the ConfigSectionCollection,
    it will fill in most fields for you.
    
    - SectionName           - SeparateLines (boolean)
    - Description           - HideOutLines  (boolean)
    - DefaultValue          - SectionStarter
    - SectionType           - SectionHeadEnder
                            - SectionEnder

    The boolean SeparateLines is used for ArrayType SectionTypes. This will determine if an Array should be
    written on one single Line, or if the Array should Split up in separate Lines.
    The boolean HideOutLines is used to determine whether or not the outlines of an Section should be written.
    If you would set the SectionOutLine to null, it will actually write 'null' as outLine. While an empty String
    ("") will still create a new Line.

       setCustomSectionStarter();   Note, the following Characters may cause conflicts: ';', '{', '}'.
    
    - setDescription();  - This will set a Description. (This will also be possible by the ConfigFile!)
    - setDefaultValue(); - This will set a DefaultValue.

    The ConfigFile! - ConfigSectionCollection
    ------------------------------

    This is an very large (and maybe confusing) Class. although it is nothing else than an Container for ConfigSections.
    The main way to add ConfigSections to your ConfigFile is by calling these methods (since the ConfigFile is considered
    an ConfigSectionCollection). There are a lot of methods (like regenerate, write, check Section) which are mainly used
    for the (easier) methods from the ConfigFile Class. you shouldn't try to use it, unless you really know what you are doing.
        
        
     Important related methods
     - addNew[SectionType]Section();   - Fore every ConfigSectionType there is an method you can use to add a ConfigSection to
                                         this ConfigSectionCollection (or ConfigFile if you call it from the ConfigFile instance)
     - insertConfigSection();          - This is mainly used for dynamically updating an ConfigFile. it will insert an
                                         ConfigSection before the targetSection in the ConfigSectionCollection.
     - removeSubConfigSection();       - This will remove an ConfigSection from the ConfigSectionCollection. This won't
                                         automatically remove the section from the actual File, but it will be when the File is
                                         regenerated.
     - clearAllConfigSections();       - This will remove all ConfigSections which are stored in this ConfigSectionCollection.
                                         Its mostly used for 'reseting' a configFile, or when you dynamically update the content
                                         of the ConfigSectionCollection.





    The ConfigFile! - ConfigFile
    ------------------------------

    This is the MainClas you want to use for your ConfigFile. There are 2 ways to register a new ConfigFile. The first option is to create
    a new ConfigFile (e.g. ConfigFile example = new ConfigFile(param.)). The second (and more advanced) option is to create a new Class, and
    extend the ConfigFile Class. That way its easier to add/modify the ConfigSections in the ConfigFile
    
    The method 'generateFile()' will be called when you call the 'LoadConfig()'. You should put all your 'addNew[SectionType]Section()'
    methods in there so the API 'know's' what the content of your ConfigFile should be.
    
    Important related methods
    - generateFile();           - You'll need to implement this method if you extend the ConfigFile Class. It will be Called when a
                                  'loadConfig()'method is called.
    - writeAllSections();       - This will write All sections, it is already called when a 'loadConfig()' method is called. Note,
                                   when its called while the file is not empty, it will simply add all the ConfigSections after the
                                  Content
    - writeSection();           - This will write a single Section if you need to. Though it will also be added to the existing content
                                  of the File.
    - checkConfigFile();        - This will return a List of all invalid ConfigSections in a configFile. a ConfigSection is considered
                                  invalid if the SectionName (ID) can't be found in the file.
    - regenerateConfigFile();   - This will regenerate the ConfigSections inside the List you put in. A 'loadConfig()' method will
                                  automatically check an configFile, and rewrite it if it couldn't find a ConfigSection.
    - getValue();               - This will return the Value of the SectionName(ID) you put in.
